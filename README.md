  Aquaeductus assignment
</h1>

## Abstract üóíÔ∏è:
Given a set of points (p), a maximum height of an aquaeduct (h)  and a beta and alpha cost variables, gives the minimum cost of the possible aqueduct and if it doesn't exists, prints impossible.

The solution of this problem has been solved with three variants: greedy, backtracking and dynamic programming.

The better solution for this problem is the dynamic programming one, which is based on the [principle of optimality of Bellman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellman_equation). The Big O notation of this algorithm is of O(n^3).

If you would like to know more about how it works, I would totally recommend reading the report of this assignment, which is found in documentation/informe.pdf. Emphasize that the report is written in Catalan,
although it has enough visual resources to understand how everything was done.

## Project structure üìÅ:

``` 
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cpp                 --> cpp code (iterative version)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ documentation       --> report of the assignment in .pdf and .tex (just in case you want to contribute or read how some resources were done)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ python              --> python code (iterative and recursive version)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ test                --> test files
```

## Running tests üèÉ DEPRECATED FOR NOW! MUST FIX!:

### Python

If you want to run the tests (for the iterative version) and the code analysis tool (for the recursive and iterative version) do:

``` 
    $ make test
```

If you would like to run only the test of the iterative version:

``` 
    $ make onlytest
```

If you want to run the **RECURSIVE** tests, do:
``` 
    $ make recursive
```

If you would like to run just the code analysis tool (pylint) without docstring warnings (because the code is self-explanatory without comments):
``` 
    $ make pylint
```

By default, the Makefile uses python as his interpreter. If you would like to change it to other like for example
[pypy3](https://www.pypy.org/) (which runs a lot faster than python3) , you can do it changing the Makefile variable to pypy3.

``` bash
interpreter=pypy3
```

### C++

For compiling the .cpp file with all the optimizations and warning checkers:

``` 
    $ make
```

For compiling and running the tests:

``` 
    $ make test
```
